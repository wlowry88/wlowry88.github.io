Will is a web developer living in New York City studying at the Flatiron School. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 2013 with a double major in Economics and Music Performance, and has since realized that his true calling lies in building applications and bettering the human experience. 

When he's not busy coding, he enjoys good food, coffee, the great outdoors, and composes electronic music.
