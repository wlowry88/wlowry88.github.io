Inspiration: We've started project mode here at the Flatiron School, and it's been an awesome experience so far. In 4 days, 100 commits, 1 night of sleep spent on a school couch, we've deployed our first app, [Friend of the Day](http://www.intouchbetter.herokuapp.com). Our app helps you to keep in touch with your friends by sending you one text reminder per day, reminding you how great they are. Everything went great with the idea phase, but before long, we realized we had a problem.
