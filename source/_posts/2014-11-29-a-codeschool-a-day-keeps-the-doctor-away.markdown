The title says it all. I'm going to try and get through all of the Ruby, Rails, and Javascript code school tutorials in the next month. Why? Because it was "free" along with the Flatiron School tuition (definitely not free either) and I might as well get the most of it before it's taken away.

Let's see how it goes - I think it can be done.
